<h1>Scrape MercadoLibre's Products</h1>

Repo with python code developed for automating the process of scraping products from MercadoLibre's website for any query you may need. It uses Requests, Pandas and BeautifulSoup to scrape the products and then saves them in an Excel file.

In the future I will put the code in a .py file so it can be used as a script and not only as a Jupyter Notebook.


<h1>Requirements</h1>

0. Python and Jupyter Notebooks installed.

1. Use pip install to install the requirements.txt using the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt` on the project root folder.

2. Run 'main.ipynb' on Jupyter Notebooks.

<h1>How to use it</h1>

After fulfilling the requirements above, simply run each step with the dedicated button to run cells or by using the shift + enter shortcut on every cell.

You can modify the query by changing the 'query' variable on the first cell of the notebook, so you can do the scrape process on any query you may need.
